## Project Purpose

This project is designed to help optimize the PlanMyTrip app through creating useful dataframes and maps for users. By allowing users to input their preferences for minimum and maximum temperature on their vacation, the PlanMyTrip app can become more accomodating to help users plan out their next vacation by providing nearby hotel information as well as map out their travel routes.
